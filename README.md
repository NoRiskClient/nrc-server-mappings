# NoRiskClient Server Mappings

This repository provides server mappings for the NoRisk Client, allowing servers to have enhanced icons, banners, and metadata displayed in the client.

## What is this?
- Supplies the NoRisk Client with improved server presentation: custom icons, banners, and descriptive metadata.
- Ensures all server assets (icons, backgrounds) follow consistent conventions for best appearance in the client.
- Contains scripts to validate and merge server manifests into a single distributable format for the client to consume.

## Structure
- `servers/` — Individual server manifests and images for each server.
- `merged/` — Output directory for merged manifests and assets (generated by scripts, used by the client).
- `scripts/` — Validation and merge scripts.
- `docs/` — Documentation for manifest and image conventions.

## Documentation
- [Manifest conventions](docs/manifest.md)
- [Image conventions](docs/conventions.md)

## Local Testing
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Use `npm run merge` to validate and merge all server manifests for the client.

---
For more details, see the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

## Step by Step Tutorial

This is a full step-by-step (hopefully) fool proof explanation on how to add your own server mapping without any prior knowledge.

#### 0. What is this exactly?

As mentioned this repository provides server mappings for the NoRisk Client, allowing servers to have enhanced icons, banners, and metadata displayed in the client. This happens by supplying a manifest in JSON format. You can find an example on how this JSON can look like [here](https://github.com/NoRiskClient/nrc-server-mappings/blob/main/servers/hypixel/manifest.json).

#### 1. Fork the Repository

To make any changes, like adding your own server, you need to 'fork' the repository. This means you create a copy, because you are not allowed to make direct changes to our version. Instead you make them in your own 'clone' and then 'ask' (aka Pull Request or PR) your changes to be merged. For this you need an account on GitHub.

#### 2. Make your changes

To create your own entry, go to `/servers` in your fork and create a folder named after your server. Then create a `manifest.json` file and fill it like outlined in the [docs](https://github.com/NoRiskClient/nrc-server-mappings/blob/main/docs/manifest.md) for the manifest. Make sure you follow the [conventions](https://github.com/NoRiskClient/nrc-server-mappings/blob/main/docs/conventions.md). Make sure you upload all referenced images and that they follow our guidelines. After you've done all of that it is time to ...

#### 3. Create the Pull Request

When you back to the project / repository root you should see a banner that says something like `This branch is 1 commit ahead of NoRiskClient/nrc-server-mappings:main.`. Click on 'Contribute' and then 'Open pull request':

Or alternatively it coul also look like this: <img width="1847" height="319" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d2e139a-fb2b-4080-8e63-f713c52612ac" />

Please take your time and fill out the checklist provided in the description. It will ask you whether you read and understood the documentation and whether your manifest meets all our requirements.

Then just click on 'Create pull request':

#### 4. Wait for a merge
